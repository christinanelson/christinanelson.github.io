summary: NuLat (neutrino lattice) is a novel detector that will measure inverse beta decay of electron anti-neutrinos in close proximity to a nuclear reactor.

  NuLat is short for neutrino lattice. This experiment is a collaboration between the University of Hawaii at Manoa, Virginia Tech, and many Universities that intends to measure antineutrino (anti-ν<sub>e</sub>) flux in close proximity (3-10m) to a nuclear reactor, in search of anomalous neutrino oscillations. Measurement of anomalous oscillations may help to illucidate the reactor anti-neutrino anomaly, and/or theories of sterile neutrinos. The NuLat detector is an array of Li<sup>6</sup> doped scintillator cells that channel the light to photomultipliers (PMTs) via total internal reflection. The cells are scintillated by the inverse beta decay (IBD) of anti-ν<sub>e</sub>. <br>
  Currently, the group I work in are callibrating and characterizing PMTs and measuring scintillator cells (also called light guides). The PDF below is a 1-minute presentation on NuLat, and also there is a more detailed presentation given by Dr.Maricic.
