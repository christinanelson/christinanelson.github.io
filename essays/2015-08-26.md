Abstract
<p align="justify">
 A program is written that implements a 3-dimensional Ising model and the Metropolis algorithm to simulate the phase transition of a ferromagnet to a paramagnet. Vanishing magnetization and a discontinuity in the average energy for simulated data is observed at the Curie temperature. Simulated data compared to experimental measurements of CoNiFeCB magnetization as a function of temperature shows that the simulation approaches the Curie temperature quicker. The Curie temperature for CoNiFeCB is measured to be approximately .  <br> <br>
