Abstract

<p align="justify">
 A program is written that implements a 3-dimensional Ising model and the Metropolis algorithm to simulate the phase transition of a ferromagnet to a paramagnet. Vanishing magnetization and a discontinuity in the average energy for simulated data is observed at the Curie temperature. Simulated data compared to experimental measurements of CoNiFeCB magnetization as a function of temperature shows that the simulation approaches the Curie temperature quicker. The Curie temperature for CoNiFeCB is measured to be approximately 600 12&nbsp;&deg;C . <br> <br>

Introduction

<p align="justify">
Ferromagnetic materials posses a spontaneous magnetic moment which arises from the
regular arrangement of their electron spins. In a ferromagnet the unpaired electrons arrange
their alignments parallel to one another within domains separated by so-called Bloch walls.
The most well known ferromagnetic materials are iron, nickel and cobalt. Upon application
of a magnetic field to a ferromagnetic sample, the domains will align and the material
is said to be magnetized. Curiously, if a ferromagnetic sample is heated above a certain
critical temperature, the sample’s magnetization disappears; this temperature is the Curie
temperature. The phase transition that takes place at the Curie temperature is from spin
aligned ferromagnetism to disordered paramagnetism. [1][2] <br>
An interesting application for ferromagnetic materials may be found in electronics such
as in ferroelectric random access memory for computers (FeRAM). [3] From these points of
interest, we aim to understand and model the phase transition at the Curie temperature that
characterize ferromagnetic samples. In this study we simulate the thermodynamic effects on
spin in a ferromagnet and compare the simulation to data collected from a CoNiFeCB sample
consisting of measurements of magnetization as a function of temperature. <br>

Ising model

<p align="justify">
The mathematical model of ferromagnetism we use is the Ising model which takes a Z
dimensional lattice and statically represents an atomic spin at each vertex. We will use a
3-dimensional model. Since the particles are fixed at each vertex, we need not be concerned
with the Pauli exclusion principle implying the antisymmetry of the wave function since no
particles may be exchanged in this system. A particle’s initial state is denoted s i and may
be either spin-up or spin-down as shown by the following relation.[2] <br>
