Abstract

<p align="justify">
 A program is written that implements a 3-dimensional Ising model and the Metropolis algorithm to simulate the phase transition of a ferromagnet to a paramagnet. Vanishing magnetization and a discontinuity in the average energy for simulated data is observed at the Curie temperature. Simulated data compared to experimental measurements of CoNiFeCB magnetization as a function of temperature shows that the simulation approaches the Curie temperature quicker. The Curie temperature for CoNiFeCB is measured to be approximately 600&nbsp;&deg;C .  <br> <br>

<!--l. 37--><p class="noindent" >  <p align="justify"> Ferromagnetic materials posses a spontaneous magnetic moment which arises from the regular
arrangement of their electron spins. In a ferromagnet the unpaired electrons arrange their
alignments parallel to one another within domains separated by so-called Bloch walls. The most
well known ferromagnetic materials are iron, nickel and cobalt. Upon application of a magnetic
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
field to a ferromagnetic sample, the domains will align and the material is said to be magnetized.
Curiously, if a ferromagnetic sample is heated above a certain critical temperature, the sample&#8217;s
magnetization disappears; this temperature is the Curie temperature. The phase transition that
takes place at the Curie temperature is from spin aligned ferromagnetism to disordered
paramagnetism. <span class="cite">[<a

<!--l. 40--><p class="indent" >   An interesting application for ferromagnetic materials may be found in electronics
such as in ferroelectric random access memory for computers (FeRAM). <span class="cite">[<a

points of interest, we aim to understand and model the phase transition at the Curie
temperature that characterize ferromagnetic samples. In this study we simulate the
thermodynamic effects on spin in a ferromagnet and compare the simulation to data collected
from a CoNiFeCB sample consisting of measurements of magnetization as a function of
temperature.

<!--l. 74--><p class="indent" >   An interesting outcome of the Boltzmann distribution which one can see in figure (1) and
which we will see more of below, is that there is no single configuration of lowest energy.
The statistical nature of the thermodynamics which effect the spin arrangements are
constantly randomly exchanging via thermal energy and the exchange field. A written
C++ program implements the Ising model in three dimensions by randomly flipping the
spin of dipole arrangements in the lattice points of a cube. After a random number
generator is seeded with number 94180717 the program is run and a loop randomly
determines spin-up or spin-down and calculates the energy based on equation (5). The
program determines lowest energy, and a three dimensional map of spin-up states is
output.

   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2.2   </span> <a 
 id="x1-40002.2"></a>Metropolis algorithm</h4>
<!--l. 77--><p class="noindent" >   The Metropolis algorithm is similar to Monte Carlo methods, but extends it to essentially be a
Markov chain Monte Carlo which allows one to apply it to the Boltzmann distribution. The notion
of the Metropolis algorithm is that the arrangements of the spins which randomly alternate
between spin-up and spin-down due to thermodynamics, are processed via the variance reduction
method and the von Neumann reduction technique. The variance reduction method reduces
computation time by obtaining a minimum variance between functions so that integration
may be solved quicker than when considering the set of smaller and larger variances
combined. The von Neumann rejection technique generates random points in a probability
distribution and counts only those point that fall within the desired weighting function.
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="#Xlandau">2</a>]</span>
<!--l. 80--><p class="indent" >   The outline of the Metropolis algorithm is the following. First, initial temperature and
configuration of all states beginning in spin-up in the 3-dimensional lattice is set and the algorithm
runs until the system reaches equilibrium. Next, a particle is chosen randomly and its spin is
flipped, this generates a statistically random configuration of which we may calculate
thermodynamic quantities such as magnetization and internal energy. After energy is calculated,
the following conditionals are the main parts of this algorithm. If <span

and set <span

class="cmmi-8">j</span><span 
class="cmr-8">+1</span></sub> = <span 
class="cmmi-12">s</span><sub><span 
class="cmmi-8">trial</span></sub>. If <span 
class="cmmi-12">E</span>(<span

class="cmmi-8">trial</span></sub>) <span 
class="cmmi-12">&#x003E; E</span>(<span 
class="cmmi-12">s</span><sub><span

class="cmsy-8">&minus;</span><span 
class="cmr-8">&Delta;</span><span 
class="cmmi-8">E&#x2215;kT</span> </sup>.
Within this last step, another random number between 0 and 1 is generated and compared to the
probability just obtained. If the random number is less than or equal to the probability, the spin
state is accepted and set to <span 
class="cmmi-12">s</span><sub><span 
class="cmmi-8">j</span><span 
class="cmr-8">+1</span></sub>, and if the probability is less than the random number,
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
the state is rejected. The key to the Metropolis algorithm is that states that are not
lowest energy are not simply thrown away because that is not how thermodynamic
statistical systems work. The states with higher energy are run through the second
conditional and determined whether it is accepted to rejected, which shows that higher
energy states although less probable are still kept to a statistical degree in the system.

<!--l. 85--><p class="noindent" >   This semester the author has been granted an Undergraduate Research Opportunity through
the University of Hawaii at Manoa (UROP) for the project: Magnetization characterization of
novel multiferroic materials, dependence of particle size, temperature, strength and gradient of
magnetic field. A summary of the experimental set up is given here. Measurements of
thermo-magnetic properties are conducted using Faraday&#8217;s balance method in an external
non-uniform magnetic field. Direct current power supply provides current for a solenoid which
induces a time constant magnetic field. The ferrite sample is placed in the measurement position
and lowered into the solenoid by use of a custom-made high temperature resistant dielectric
diamagnetic holder. The measurement of the magnetic field is done by a high precision balance, the
Sartorius Entris 64-1S.
<!--l. 88--><p class="indent" >   During the complete duration of measurement while the sample is in the magnetic field,
temperature is monitored with a high precision electronic thermometer and using a high
temperature resistant thermocouple. Magnetization is measured up to 900K in steps of 20K. The
sample is heated in a custom made electric oven where a variable transformer is used to provide
power to the oven which enables excellent control over the heating rate. Controlling the heating
rate is important since the temperature gradient is one of the parameters which strongly influence
the magnetization of the sample.
<!--l. 90--><p class="indent" >   The goal of the UROP experiment is to measure the magnetic and electric properties of several
ferroic materials as a function of temperature and particle size. The aim is to find the optimal
compound mixture and thermal preparation, and to establish the relationship between composition
and thermal treatment compared to material performance. The initial compound of CoNiFeCB is
measured and discussed in this paper, with more samples to be measured in the Spring of 2017.

because the sample we are working with is not a pure ferromagnet. If the sample only included, say
Fe, one would expect a better fit between data and simulated results. An interesting point to note
is that after magnetization reaches a minimum, in both cases a slight increase in magnetization is
observed. Data should be taken in an extended temperature region with the CoNiFeCB

<!--l. 143--><p class="noindent" >   A 3-dimensional Ising model with the Metropolis algorithm is successfully implemented in a
C++ program, and simulation of the phase transition of a ferromagnet at high temperature is
observed. The Curie temperature is also observed as a discontinuity in the total average energy of
the system as temperature increases and as peaks in specific heat and susceptibility in the
simulated data. Magnetization simulation is compared to measured data from CoNiFeCB as a
function of temperature. Shapes between functions of simulation and data show the simulation
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
approaches the Curie temperature quicker than our experimental measurements. This is
most likely because the ferromagnetic sample we are using, CoNiFeCB, is not a pure
ferromagnet.
