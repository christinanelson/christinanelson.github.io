This report is an overview of repairing a M ̈ossbauer experiment for an upper level undergraduate
modern physics lab. After obtaining a stronger Co 57 source, measurements were taken with a
stainless steel and iron absorber to observe nuclear resonant absorption and radiation. The line
width with the stainless steel absorber is Γ = (0.084 ± 0.006) × 10 −13 mm/s, and the fractional
line width is (1.407 ± 0.101) × 10 −13 . This is in good agreement with the known value of fractional
width from the excited state of Co 57 to its ground state. It is also found that a piece of equipment
is malfunctioning, namely the drive module, but a solution for “calibration on the fly” is proposed.
