Abstract

  This report is an overview of repairing a M ̈ossbauer experiment for an upper level undergraduate
modern physics lab. After obtaining a stronger Co 57 source, measurements were taken with a
stainless steel and iron absorber to observe nuclear resonant absorption and radiation. The line
width with the stainless steel absorber is Γ = (0.084 ± 0.006) × 10 −13 mm/s, and the fractional
line width is (1.407 ± 0.101) × 10 −13 . This is in good agreement with the known value of fractional
width from the excited state of Co 57 to its ground state. It is also found that a piece of equipment
is malfunctioning, namely the drive module, but a solution for “calibration on the fly” is proposed.


  The first observation of nuclear resonance absorption was made in 1951 by British nuclear
physicist Philip B. Moon. In 1957, under the guidance of H. Leibnitz, while at the Max Plank
Institute, R. M ̈ossbauer discovered recoilless nuclear resonance absorption. This discovery was
awarded with the 1961 nobel in Physics, and is often referred to as the M ̈ossbauer effect.[1] Be-
cause the M ̈ossbauer effect enables high precision measurements of energy it has a wide range
of modern applications in nuclear physics, solid state physics, chemistry, and industry. Also,
NASA has sent a M ̈ossbauer spectrometer to Mars mounted on a rover to study the iron min-
erals of the Martian surface.[2]
