   For neutrino detectors with large scale, it is a new challenge to design an affordable and effective large-are photon detection (PD) system. The PD system also needs to provide trigger on non-beam events such as proton decay, atmospheric neutrinos and astrophysical neutrinos, as well as good event timing resolution.
   The silicon photomultiplier or silicon photoelectron multipliers (SiPMs) are highly attractive photo sensors for the new PD system.
